= LINZ NZTopo Processing Scripts =

Part of the NZ GeoData Scripts project:
  http://code.google.com/p/nz-geodata-scripts/

This script generates Shapefiles from the raw LSLIFF data (*.iff files) as 
provided to purchasers of the LINZ NZTopo extracts. Each layer in the LSLIFF 
theme (a .iff file) ends up as a Shapefile.

Requirements:
 - Python >= 2.4
 - GDAL/OGR, built with the Python bindings

For support, head to the NZ Open GIS group at:
  http://groups.google.co.nz/group/nzopengis

== Running the converter ==

To display help and usage information:

  python iff2shp.py --help

To convert:

  python iff2shp.py /path/to/my.iff

For each .iff file, a folder under the current working directory will be 
created, which contains the output Shapefiles.

Notes:
 * for Chatham Islands data, you will need to setup the projection details (as 
   WKT) in your GDAL data dir (eg. /usr/share/gdal/esri_extra.wkt) and specify 
   -S on the command line. (Unless EPSG actually adds Chatham Islands TM with an
   official number).
 * If you're getting weird file errors, you may have run into the maximum open
   files limit for your system. This is quite possible under OSX, less so Linux.
   You can increase the limit using ulimit (eg. 'ulimit -n 1024').
