# New Zealand GeoData Processing Scripts #

A set of scripts for importing and manipulating geospatial data from NZ organisations (particularly goverment ones), including:

  * [Land Information New Zealand](http://www.linz.govt.nz/)
  * [Statistics New Zealand](http://www.stats.govt.nz/)
  * [New Zealand Historic Places Trust](http://www.historic.org.nz/)

### What scripts are there? ###

  * LinzCadastral: A set of scripts to process and extract some useful datasets from the LINZ LandOnline cadastral bulk extract.
  * LinzTopo: A script build shapefiles from the LINZ NZTopo LSLIFF extracts.
  * HistoricPlaces: A script to scrape the [Historic Places register](http://www.historic.org.nz/register.html) and build a JSON data file.

### How do I use them? ###

See the wiki page for each set of scripts, and the README file once you've downloaded them. Some of the scripts are a bit rough-and-ready, we'd appreciate fixes to make them more robust and flexible when run on different systems.

### Support ###

Questions and discussions about the scripts, or ideas for new ones, are welcome on the [NZ Open GIS](http://groups.google.com/group/nzopengis) group. If you find bugs, please [report them](http://code.google.com/p/nz-geodata-scripts/issues/entry).

### Contributions ###

Contributions of all types: new scripts and especially bug fixes are welcome. If you're interested, get in contact via the Issue Tracker, or via the [NZ Open GIS](http://groups.google.com/group/nzopengis) group.

### History ###

The initial set of scripts were created by [Koordinates](http://koordinates.com) for internal projects and open sourced in September 2008.
